  // How to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich:
	//	find a loaf of pre-sliced bread in the pantry 
	//	find peanut butter in the pantry (I like chunky Skippy)
	//	find jelly in the fridge (I like raspberry)
	//	find a butterknife in your kitchen
	//	put two slices of bread on a plate
	//	open the peanut butter and jelly jars
	//	use your butterknife and scoop out some peanut butter 
	//	spread peanut butter generously on one piece of bread
	//	clean off your butterknife 
	//	use your butterknife and scoop out some jelly 
	//	spread jelly generously on the other piece of bread
	//	clean off your butterknife again
	//	close lids of peanut butter and jelly jars
	//	put the rest of the loaf and the peanut butter back in the pantry
	//	put the jelly back in the fridge
	//	put the two sides of bread together, so that the peanut butter and jelly are touching
	//	take your clean butterknife and slice diagonally through the sandwich
	//	take a bite and enjoy :)
