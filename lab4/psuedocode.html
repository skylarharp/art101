			<h1>Lab 4-Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Psuedocode Rock Paper Scissors successfully</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We were a little confused by the instructions at times, but we figured it out.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We didn't know whether we had to actually code the game or just psuedocode the instructions. We assumed that we just need to psuedocode.  </p>

					// How to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich:
					<br>
					//	find a loaf of pre-sliced bread in the pantry 
					<br>
					//	find peanut butter in the pantry (I like chunky Skippy)
					<br>
					//	find jelly in the fridge (I like raspberry)
					<br>
					//	find a butterknife in your kitchen
					<br>
					//	put two slices of bread on a plate
					<br>
					//	open the peanut butter and jelly jars
					<br>
					//	use your butterknife and scoop out some peanut butter 
					<br>
					//	spread peanut butter generously on one piece of bread
					<br>
					//	clean off your butterknife 
					<br>
					//	use your butterknife and scoop out some jelly 
					<br>
					//	spread jelly generously on the other piece of bread
					<br>
					//	clean off your butterknife again
					<br>
					//	close lids of peanut butter and jelly jars
					<br>
					//	put the rest of the loaf and the peanut butter back in the pantry
					<br>
					//	put the jelly back in the fridge
					<br>
					//	put the two sides of bread together, so that the peanut butter and jelly are touching
					<br>
					//	take your clean butterknife and slice diagonally through the sandwich
					<br>
					//	take a bite and enjoy :)
